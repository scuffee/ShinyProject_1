### Course Project: Weight management plan
### The ui.R and server.R scripts were created to calculate how long it
### would take to lose up to 50 pounds by reducing caloric intake over a number
### of days.  In this calculator one pound is equal to 3500 calories.  A 
### reduction in 3500 calories is a reduction of 1 pound. The input     
### variables pounds and calorie represent desired weight loss and daily
### calorie reduction. The minimum value for pounds is 5 and calorie is 100.
### The default input values are 10 for pounds and 100 for calorie is 100. 
### Pounds can be incremented by 5, up to the maximum of 50 and calorie can
### be incremented by 50 up to the maximum of 800.  The prediction variable
### represents the number of days required to lose up to 50 pounds based on
### the pound and calorie input values and pressing the submit buttons to
### calculate the number of days.  The default values are 10 pounds and 100 
### 100 calories per day, would require 350 days to lose 10 pounds.
