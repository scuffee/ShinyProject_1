### Course Project: Ten pound weight loss calculator
### The ui.R and server.R scripts were created to calculate how long it
### would take to lose 10 pounds by reducing caloric intake over a number of
### days.  In this calculator one pound is equal to 3500 calaories.  A 
### reduction in 3500 calories is a reduction of 1 pound and 35,000 calories =
### ten pounds. The variable calorie represents the daily caloric reduction, 
### the default input value is 100, which can be incremented by 50 up to 
### the maximum of 1000.  The prediction variable represents the number of
### days required to lose ten pounds based on the calorie input value and
### epressing the submit button to calculate the number of days.
### The default is set at 100 calorie daily reduction that would require 350
### days to lose ten pounds.
