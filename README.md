## Course Project: Ten pound weight loss calculator
## The ui.R and server.R scripts were created to calculate how long it
## would take to lose 10 pounds by reducing caloric intake over a number of
## days.  In this calculator one pound is equal to 3500 calaories.  A 
## reduction in 3500 calories is a reduction of 1 pound.  the variable calorie
## represents the daily caloric reduction, the default is 100, an the input 
## can be increased by 100 up to a maximum of 1000.  The prediction variable
## represents the number of days required to lose ten pounds based on the 
## calorie input value.  The default is set at 100 calorie daily reduction
## that would require 350 days to lose ten pounds.
